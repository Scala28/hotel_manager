# hotel_manager
Simple hotel management system done in c# winforms; it connects to a local database using  MySqlConnector NuGet package.
By default it connects to local socket: 127.0.0.1:3306. I used Xampp [free open-source cross-platform server solution] 
to open a connection and HeidiSQL as DB Manager System.
